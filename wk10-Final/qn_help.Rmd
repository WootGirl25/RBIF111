# Question 1

You're off to a great start! Let's break this down and clarify how **TMB (Tumor Mutational Burden)** fits into the model and how to proceed with the analysis.

---

### üîç Clarifying the Question

The question asks you to:

1. **Build a linear regression model** with:
   - **Input (independent variable)**: `ER_Status_By_IHC` (categorical: Positive/Negative)
   - **Output (dependent variable)**: `Overall_Survival_Months` (continuous)

2. **Calculate the 95% confidence interval** for the regression coefficients.

3. **Explain**:
   - The **coefficients** (especially for ER status)
   - Their **95% confidence intervals**
   - The **p-value for TMB_nonsynonymous**

---

### üß† So, where does TMB come in?

Even though the initial model is just `OSM ~ ER`, the question also asks for the **p-value for TMB**, which implies that **TMB should be included in the model**.

So, you should **extend your model** to include `TMB_nonsynonymous` as an additional predictor:

```r
# Filter and clean data
ers.osm.df <- pData[pData$ER_Status_By_IHC %in% c("Positive", "Negative") & 
                    !is.na(pData$Overall_Survival_Months) & 
                    !is.na(pData$TMB_nonsynonymous), 
                    c("ER_Status_By_IHC", "Overall_Survival_Months", "TMB_nonsynonymous")]

# Rename columns for clarity
colnames(ers.osm.df) <- c("ER", "OSM", "TMB")

# Convert ER to factor
ers.osm.df$ER <- factor(ers.osm.df$ER, levels = c("Negative", "Positive"))

# Fit linear model with TMB included
ers.osm.lm <- lm(OSM ~ ER + TMB, data = ers.osm.df)

# Summary of the model
summary(ers.osm.lm)

# 95% confidence intervals
confint(ers.osm.lm)
```

---

### üßæ Interpretation Guide

- **Coefficients**:
  - The intercept represents the expected survival months for ER-negative patients with TMB = 0.
  - The coefficient for `ERPositive` shows the difference in survival months between ER-positive and ER-negative patients.
  - The coefficient for `TMB` shows the change in survival months for each unit increase in TMB.

- **95% Confidence Intervals**:
  - These give a range in which the true coefficient is likely to fall 95% of the time.
  - If the CI for a coefficient does **not** include 0, it's statistically significant.

- **p-value for TMB**:
  - Tells you whether TMB is a statistically significant predictor of survival.
  - A p-value < 0.05 typically indicates significance.

# Question 2
To include TMB

Great question! You're now moving into **survival analysis**, and the Cox regression model is the right tool for this. Let's walk through how to incorporate **TMB** into the **Cox proportional hazards model**, and how to interpret the results.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Plan for the Cox Regression Model**

#### 1. **Filter and Prepare the Data**
- Keep only rows where `ER_Status_By_IHC` is "Positive" or "Negative"
- Remove rows with `NA` or "Indeterminate" in:
  - `ER_Status_By_IHC`
  - `Overall_Survival_Months`
  - `Overall_Survival_Status`
  - `TMB_nonsynonymous`

#### 2. **Convert Survival Status**
- `Overall_Survival_Status` should be binary:
  - 1 = event occurred (e.g., death)
  - 0 = censored (e.g., still alive)

#### 3. **Fit the Cox Model**
```r
library(survival)

# Clean and prepare data
cox.df <- pData[pData$ER_Status_By_IHC %in% c("Positive", "Negative") &
                !is.na(pData$Overall_Survival_Months) &
                !is.na(pData$Overall_Survival_Status) &
                !is.na(pData$TMB_nonsynonymous), 
                c("ER_Status_By_IHC", "Overall_Survival_Months", "Overall_Survival_Status", "TMB_nonsynonymous")]

# Rename columns
colnames(cox.df) <- c("ER", "OSM", "Status", "TMB")

# Convert ER to factor
cox.df$ER <- factor(cox.df$ER, levels = c("Negative", "Positive"))

# Convert survival status to binary (assuming "Dead" = 1, "Alive" = 0)
cox.df$Status <- ifelse(cox.df$Status == "Dead", 1, 0)

# Fit Cox model
cox.model <- coxph(Surv(OSM, Status) ~ ER + TMB, data = cox.df)

# Summary
summary(cox.model)

# 95% Confidence Intervals for Hazard Ratios (Odds Ratios)
exp(confint(cox.model))
```

---

### üìà Kaplan-Meier Curve

To visualize survival by ER status:

```r
library(survminer)

# Fit survival object
surv.obj <- Surv(cox.df$OSM, cox.df$Status)

# Fit Kaplan-Meier
km.fit <- survfit(surv.obj ~ ER, data = cox.df)

# Plot
ggsurvplot(km.fit, data = cox.df, pval = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE,
           risk.table = TRUE, legend.labs = c("ER Negative", "ER Positive"),
           title = "Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve by ER Status")
```

---

### üßæ Interpretation

- **Hazard Ratio (HR)**:
  - `exp(coef)` gives the **hazard ratio** (similar to odds ratio in logistic regression).
  - HR > 1: higher risk of death.
  - HR < 1: lower risk of death.

- **95% Confidence Interval**:
  - If the CI for a variable **does not include 1**, it's statistically significant.

- **p-value for TMB**:
  - Tells you whether TMB is a significant predictor of survival.
  - A small p-value (typically < 0.05) means TMB significantly affects survival.

Would you like me to simulate this analysis with example data and generate the Kaplan-Meier plot for you?

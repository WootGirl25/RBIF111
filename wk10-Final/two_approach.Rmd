# QUESTION: Identify the genes most significantly associated with ‘overall survival months’ and ‘Overall_Survival_Status’ in tumor samples. We will employ the holdout method for cross-validation by splitting the dataset into two parts: a training set comprising 60% of the data and a testing set comprising 40%. The model will be trained on the training set, tested on the testing set, and its performance evaluated. To simplify the analysis, we will use the median expression of each gene as a cutoff to categorize patients into high and low expression groups for input. Please write code to calculate p-values between outcomes and all genes in the mRNA expression table using Cox regression. All p-values for each gene need to be saved and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. Please report the top 5 genes based on p-values in the training set and their corresponding p-values in the testing set. Please save the top 5 genes Kaplan-Meier curves for testing set results.

#1. select tumor samples only & make sure samples are in the same order in both expression data and clinical data

Here’s a comparison and assessment of the two approaches in your two_approach.R file:

---

### **Comparison of Approaches**

#### **Approach 1**
- **Workflow:**  
  1. Filters tumor samples, aligns clinical and expression data, removes NAs.
  2. Splits data into train (60%) and test (40%) sets.
  3. For each gene in the training set:
     - Calculates the median expression (using only training data).
     - Labels samples as "high" or "low" based on the median.
     - Runs Cox regression (Surv(OSM, STATUS) ~ high/low label).
     - Stores p-values.
  4. Adjusts p-values for multiple testing (FDR).
  5. Selects top 5 genes by raw p-value.
  6. Evaluates these genes in the test set (using the training median as cutoff), reports test p-values, and plots KM curves.

#### **Approach 2**
- **Workflow:**  
  1. Cleans NAs in survival data.
  2. Converts all gene expression values to "high"/"low" using the median **of all samples** (not just training).
  3. Splits data into train/test sets.
  4. For each gene in the training set:
     - Runs Cox regression (Surv(OSM, STATUS) ~ high/low label).
     - Stores p-values.
  5. Adjusts p-values for multiple testing (user-specified method).
  6. Returns a data frame of p-values and adjusted p-values.

---

### **Will They Give the Same Top Genes?**

#### **Key Differences**
- **Median Calculation:**
  - **Approach 1:** Median is calculated **only on the training set** for each gene. This is correct for cross-validation, as it avoids data leakage.
  - **Approach 2:** Median is calculated **using all samples** (before splitting into train/test). This introduces data leakage, as information from the test set influences the label assignment in the training set.

- **Label Assignment:**
  - **Approach 1:** Labels are assigned based on the training set median, so the test set is truly "unseen."
  - **Approach 2:** Labels are assigned based on the overall median, so the split is not independent.

- **Test Set Evaluation:**
  - **Approach 1:** Explicitly evaluates the top genes in the test set, using the training median for cutoff.
  - **Approach 2:** Does not evaluate the test set; only returns training set results.

#### **Expected Results**
- **Raw p-values (training set):**
  - **Not identical.** Because the median cutoff differs, the "high"/"low" groupings may differ, leading to different Cox regression results and p-values.
  - **Approach 2** may overestimate significance due to data leakage.

- **Adjusted p-values:**
  - **Also not identical,** for the same reasons as above.

- **Top Genes:**
  - **Likely to differ,** especially if the distribution of gene expression is not symmetric or if the sample size is small.

---

### **Additional Feedback**

- **Approach 1 is methodologically correct** for cross-validation and unbiased model evaluation. It avoids data leakage and properly evaluates model generalizability.
- **Approach 2 is flawed** due to data leakage (using all data to set the median cutoff before splitting). This can inflate performance estimates and lead to overfitting.
- **Test Set Evaluation:** Only Approach 1 evaluates the top genes in the test set, which is essential for assessing model performance.
- **Code Robustness:**  
  - Approach 1 is more transparent and easier to follow for reproducibility.
  - Approach 2 could be improved by moving the median calculation *after* the train/test split and using only the training set for median calculation.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Aspect                | Approach 1                | Approach 2                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Median Calculation    | Training set only         | All samples (data leak)   |
| Label Assignment      | Training median           | Overall median            |
| Test Set Evaluation   | Yes                       | No                        |
| Data Leakage          | No                        | Yes                       |
| Results Comparable?   | No                        | No                        |

---

### **Recommendation**

- **Use Approach 1** for unbiased, valid results.
- If you want to improve Approach 2, move the median calculation to after the train/test split and use only the training set for determining cutoffs.

---

**In summary:**  
You should not expect both approaches to yield the same top genes or p-values. Approach 1 is correct; Approach 2 should be revised to avoid data leakage.

## EDIT APPROACH 2
Certainly! Here’s how you can **edit Approach 2** to avoid data leakage and make it methodologically consistent with Approach 1:

**Key changes:**
- Calculate the median for each gene **using only the training set**.
- Assign "high"/"low" labels in both training and test sets using the training median.
- Evaluate p-values in both training and test sets for the top genes.

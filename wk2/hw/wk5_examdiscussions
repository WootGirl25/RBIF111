1. > The Student’s t-test assumes normality in the data being analyzed, so once the data was partitioned by the gene of interest and the outcome variable, I performed a Shapiro-Wilks test to determine whether the data follow a normal distribution. The test produced p-values of <2.2e-16 for the tumor samples and 1.746e-06 for the normal tissues. Since these values are far below the 0.05 threshold, the null hypothesis of normality is rejected. This indicates that the raw gene expression data is significantly different from a normal distribution, suggesting that the data might follow another distribution, be skewed, or perhaps include outliers.

> Because the raw data do not meet the assumption of normality, I couldn’t directly apply a t-test to it. However, by leveraging the central limit theorem, I ran 1000 simulations with a sample size of 30 for each simulation. I then computed the means for these simulated samples, which—thanks to the central limit theorem—are approximately normally distributed. At this point, the original paired structure is lost, as the focus is now on comparing independent sample means derived from tumor and normal tissues. Consequently, the appropriate test to use in this scenario is a two-sample t-test rather than a paired t-test. The null hypothesis for this test is that there is no difference in the underlying means of ERBB2 expression between the tumor and normal samples.

> The p-value from the two-sample t-test is <2.2e-16. This extremely low p-value means that if there were no true difference between the groups, the probability of observing the current—or a more extreme—difference would be nearly zero. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in ERBB2 expression. Additionally, the test provides a 95% confidence interval of approximately 388 to 589, which indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true mean difference in expression levels lies within this range. This confidence interval, being far from zero, further reinforces the significance of the difference observed. Lastly, the sample estimate shows that, on average, tumor samples exhibit about 489 units higher expression than normal samples.

> It is important to note that while using a two-sample t-test on the original paired data would have been problematic—since it ignores the inherent dependency between paired observations—the transformation of the data via simulation into independent sample means makes the two-sample t-test the correct and robust approach in this instance.

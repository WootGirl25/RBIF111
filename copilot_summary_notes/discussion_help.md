## **1. Linear Regression**
### **Purpose:**  
Linear regression is used to **predict a continuous dependent variable** based on **one or more independent variables**. It assumes a **linear relationship** between them.

### **Equation:**  
\[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
\]
- \( y \) = predicted value (dependent variable)
- \( X \) = independent variable (continuous or categorical)
- \( \beta_0 \) = intercept (where the regression line meets the y-axis)
- \( \beta_1 \) = slope (the change in \( y \) per unit increase in \( X \))
- \( \epsilon \) = error term (captures variability not explained by \( X \))

### **Can Linear Regression Handle Categorical Variables?**
Yes! You *can* use categorical predictors in linear regression by converting them into **dummy variables**:
- **Binary categories (e.g., Male/Female):** Convert into **one dummy variable** (e.g., Male = 0, Female = 1).
- **Multiple categories (e.g., Region A, B, C):** Convert into **multiple dummy variables** (e.g., Region A = (1,0), Region B = (0,1), Region C = (0,0)).

### **Example Model:**
If we want to predict **salary** based on **education level (Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs, PhD)** using linear regression:

\[
\text{Salary} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{Master's}) + \beta_2 (\text{PhD}) + \epsilon
\]

- **Bachelor‚Äôs degree** is the **baseline category** (automatically set to zero).
- Master's and PhD are represented as **dummy variables** (1 if the person holds the degree, 0 otherwise).
- The coefficients **Œ≤‚ÇÅ and Œ≤‚ÇÇ** tell us **how much more salary is expected** compared to the baseline (Bachelor‚Äôs).

### **Key Assumptions:**
- **Linear relationship** between predictors and \( y \).
- **Homoscedasticity** (constant variance of residuals).
- **Normality of residuals**.
- **Independence** of observations.
- **No multicollinearity** (especially when using multiple categorical predictors).

‚úÖ **Works well in multiple linear regression** when combined with **continuous variables**.  
üö´ **Not ideal if the categorical variable has too many levels**‚Äîtoo many dummy variables can **reduce efficiency**.

### **Alternative Approach: Logistic Regression**
If your **dependent variable is categorical**, **linear regression is NOT the right choice**‚Äîuse **logistic regression instead**.

## **2. Multiple Linear Regression**
### **Purpose:**  
Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of **simple linear regression** but includes **multiple independent variables** to better predict the dependent variable.

### **Equation:**  
\[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon
\]
- \( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \) represent multiple independent variables.
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n \) represent their respective effects on \( y \).

### **Example Use Cases:**  
- Predicting **house prices** using **square footage, number of bedrooms, and location**.
- Estimating **customer spending** based on **age, income, and previous purchases**.

### **Key Assumptions:**  
- **Same assumptions as linear regression**, plus:
- **No multicollinearity** (independent variables shouldn‚Äôt be highly correlated).
- **Adequate sample size** (to avoid overfitting with too many predictors).
- **Categorical predictors must be converted into dummy variables**.

## **3. Logistic Regression**
### **Purpose:**  
Logistic regression predicts **binary or categorical outcomes** (e.g., Yes/No, Win/Loss, Success/Failure). It **models probabilities**, ensuring predictions stay between **0 and 1**.

### **Equation (Logit Transformation):**  
\[
P = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}}
\]
- \( P \) = probability of an event occurring.
- The regression equation models **the log-odds** of an event happening.

### **Example Use Cases:**  
- **Predicting whether a customer will churn** (leave a service).
- **Diagnosing disease probability** based on medical test results.

### **Key Assumptions:**  
- **Binary outcome** variable.
- **Linearity** between **log-odds of the outcome** and predictors.
- **No extreme outliers** (logistic regression is sensitive to outliers).

---

## **4. Cox Proportional Hazards Model**
### **Purpose:**  
Used in **Survival Analysis**, the Cox Model estimates **time until an event occurs**, considering multiple explanatory variables.

### **Equation:**  
\[
h(t) = h_0(t) e^{\beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_n X_n}
\]
- \( h(t) \) = **hazard rate** (risk of event happening at time \( t \))
- \( h_0(t) \) = **baseline hazard function** (not explicitly modeled)
- \( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \) = explanatory variables

### **Example Use Cases:**  
- **Predicting time until disease relapse** based on gene expression.
- **Estimating survival time of patients based on treatment type**.

### **Key Assumptions:**  
- **Proportional hazards assumption** (hazard ratios remain constant over time).
- **No time-dependent covariates** (variables influencing survival should not change over time).

## **Is ANOVA a Regression Model or a Model Evaluation Tool?**
### **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) Explained**
ANOVA is **not a regression model**‚Äîit‚Äôs a **statistical technique** used to assess **how well a model performs** by **comparing means across different groups**.

It helps determine whether a **categorical independent variable** significantly affects a **continuous dependent variable**.

### **How ANOVA Relates to Regression**
- **One-Way ANOVA** compares means across **multiple groups**.
- **In regression**, ANOVA tests **if independent variables significantly explain variance in \( y \)**.

### **Can You Use ANOVA on Any Type of Regression?**
- Yes! ANOVA can assess **linear and multiple regression models**.
- **For logistic regression**, a similar test (**deviance or likelihood ratio test**) is used.
- **Cox models use Chi-square tests** rather than ANOVA.

---

## **Final Thoughts**
- **You can use categorical variables in linear regression**, but they must be **converted into dummy variables**.
- **ANOVA is a model evaluation tool**, not a regression method.
- You **can use ANOVA in linear and multiple regression models**.
- **For logistic and Cox models**, alternative statistical tests (like likelihood ratio or Chi-square tests) are used.

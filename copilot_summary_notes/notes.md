A simple linear model using all data is best for:

- **Exploratory analysis:** Quickly identifying potential associations or patterns in your data.
- **Feature ranking:** Getting an initial idea of which genes/features are most strongly related to the outcome.
- **Hypothesis generation:** Suggesting candidates for further, more rigorous analysis.

**However:**  
It does **not** provide reliable estimates for prediction or generalization, since it can overfit to the specific dataset.

**Summary:**  
Use the simple linear model for exploration and initial insights, not for robust prediction.

**Cross-validation and bootstrapping** are best for:

- **Estimating model performance:** They provide more accurate estimates of how well your model will generalize to new, unseen data.
- **Reducing overfitting:** By repeatedly splitting the data, they help prevent models from fitting noise or specific quirks in your dataset.
- **Feature selection:** They help identify features (genes) that are consistently predictive across different data splits.
- **Model comparison:** Allow you to compare different models or features in a fair, unbiased way.

**Summary:**  
Cross-validation and bootstrapping are best for robust, reliable prediction and model evaluation.

QN1.
For **question 1**, you should:

1. **Briefly explain cross-validation** (what it is, why it’s used).
2. **Show code** that partitions data for cross-validation (e.g., using `caret` or `rsample` in R).
3. **Include a plot** (e.g., a diagram showing data splits, or a barplot of fold sizes).
4. **Describe the code** (what each part does).
5. **Discuss potential issues** (e.g., data leakage, imbalanced folds, overfitting).

### Example Structure

#### 1. Explanation
> Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how a predictive model will generalize to an independent dataset. The most common type is k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k equally sized folds...

#### 5. Potential Issues
> Potential issues include data leakage (where information from the test set leaks into the training set), imbalanced folds (especially with rare classes), and overfitting if the same data is used for both model selection and evaluation.

Of course! Here’s a beginner-friendly version with comments explaining each step:

````r
# Set a random seed so results are the same every time you run the code
set.seed(123)

# Let's say we have 150 samples (like the iris dataset)
n_samples <- 150

# We want to split the data into 5 folds
k_folds <- 5

# Randomly mix up the sample numbers from 1 to 150
shuffled_indices <- sample(1:n_samples)

# Divide the shuffled numbers into 5 groups (folds)
fold_numbers <- cut(1:n_samples, breaks = k_folds, labels = FALSE)

# Put the sample numbers for each fold into a list
folds_list <- split(shuffled_indices, fold_numbers)

# Count how many samples are in each fold
fold_sizes <- sapply(folds_list, length)

# Make a barplot to show the number of samples in each fold
barplot(fold_sizes, 
        main = "Number of Samples in Each Fold (5-Fold Cross-Validation)",
        xlab = "Fold", 
        ylab = "Number of Samples")
````

**What this code does:**
- Randomly shuffles your data.
- Splits it into 5 groups (folds).
- Shows how many samples are in each group with a barplot.

Great question! Here’s how to clarify the workflow and the **role of training vs. test sets** in cross-validation:

---

### **What the instructions mean**

1. **For each simulation (repeat 50 times):**
    - Split your data into 5 folds (cross-validation).
    - For each fold:
        - **Training set:** Use 4 folds to train the model.
        - **Test set:** Use the remaining fold to test the model.

2. **Within each training set:**
    - Fit a linear model for each gene: `DFS_Time ~ gene_expression`.
    - **Select the best fit gene** (e.g., lowest MSE or highest R²) **using only the training data**.
    - Save the name of this gene.

3. **Still within the training set:**
    - **Refit the model** for the best gene using the training data (this is to get the model coefficients).

4. **Now use the test set:**
    - Use the model (from the training set) to **predict DFS_Time in the test set**.
    - Calculate the squared errors between the predicted and actual DFS_Time in the test set.
    - Save these squared errors.

5. **Repeat for all folds and all simulations.**

---

### **Why refit on the training set?**
- You always fit (train) your model on the training data only, **never on the test set**.
- The test set is used **only to evaluate** the model’s performance (e.g., by calculating squared errors).
- The instructions say "refit the model on the training data set using the best fit gene" because you want to use the training data to estimate the model parameters for that gene, then use those parameters to predict on the test set.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Step                | Data Used      | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Model fitting       | Training set  | Find best gene, fit model coefficients       |
| Model evaluation    | Test set      | Predict DFS_Time, calculate squared errors   |

---

### **If you fit on the test set**
- This would be **data leakage** and would overestimate model performance.  
- The test set must only be used for evaluation, never for model selection or fitting.

---

**In summary:**  
- **Training set:** Used to select the best gene and fit the model.
- **Test set:** Used to evaluate the model’s predictive performance (squared errors).
- The instructions are correct: you refit the model on the training set, then use it to predict on the test set.

Let me know if you want example code for this workflow!

### **Summary of improvements**
- Store best gene names and squared errors for each simulation.
- Use a loop for bootstrapping.
- Aggregate and summarize results at the end.

Let me know if you want this tailored further or explained in more detail!

Certainly! Here’s what this section is asking you to do:

---

### **1. "Compare the results of the top most frequently identified genes"**

- **What to do:**  
  After running all your bootstrapped cross-validation simulations, count how many times each gene was selected as the "best" gene (i.e., the gene with the strongest association/predictive value in each fold of each simulation).
- **How to present:**  
  List or plot the top 5 (or more) genes that were most frequently chosen as "best" across all simulations and folds.  
  This shows which genes are most consistently identified as important by your model selection process.

---

### **2. "Compare ... the mean squared error estimates using a boxplot."**

- **What to do:**  
  For each simulation, you have a set of squared errors (from predicting on the test sets).  
  Calculate the **mean squared error (MSE)** for each simulation.
- **How to present:**  
  Create a **boxplot** of these mean squared errors across all simulations.  
  This visualizes the distribution of your model’s prediction accuracy (lower MSE = better predictive performance).

---

### **What are you comparing?**

- **Gene selection stability:**  
  Are the same genes consistently chosen as "best," or does it vary a lot between simulations?
- **Model performance stability:**  
  How much does the prediction error (MSE) vary between simulations? Is your model selection process robust?

---

### **Summary Table**

| What to show                        | Why?                                         |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Top most frequently selected genes   | Shows which genes are most robustly "best"   |
| Boxplot of mean squared errors       | Shows variability and typical accuracy       |

---

**In summary:**  
You are being asked to show (1) which genes are most often selected as best predictors, and (2) how consistent and accurate your model’s predictions are across all bootstrapped simulations, using a boxplot of MSEs.

Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of each topic point from your notes:

---

### **1. Random Variables**
- **Definition**: A random variable is a process or quantity that can take different values due to randomness. These values are not fixed but depend on chance.
  - Example: The number of alpha particles emitted by a radioactive sample in one second is a random variable. It changes every second because of the inherent randomness in radioactive decay.
- **Notation**:
  - Capital letters (e.g., `X`) represent the random variable (the process).
  - Lowercase letters (e.g., `x`) represent specific values the random variable can take (realizations).
  - Example: `X = x` means the random variable `X` took the value `x` in a specific instance.
- **Objective vs Subjective Randomness**:
  - **Objective randomness**: Comes from natural laws (e.g., radioactive decay).
  - **Subjective randomness**: Comes from incomplete knowledge (e.g., gene expression variability due to unknown factors).

### **2. Examples of Random Variables**
1. **Physical Processes**:
   - Radioactive decay: The number of particles emitted in a second is random.
   - Photon emission: The number of photons emitted by a laser in a second is random.
2. **Everyday Examples**:
   - Number of phone calls received by a call center in a minute.
   - Number of node failures in a compute farm in a day.
   - These examples are mathematically similar to physical processes if we assume each event (e.g., a customer calling) has a small, independent probability of occurring.
3. **Gene Expression**:
   - Gene expression levels in different patients vary due to unknown factors, making it appear random.
4. **Sampling from a Population**:
   - If we measure blood pressure in a random sample of 100 people, the mean blood pressure of the sample is a random variable because it changes with each new sample.

### **3. Probability Distributions**
- **Definition**: A probability distribution describes the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable.
  - Example: For a fair coin toss, the probability of heads (`P(X=H)`) is 0.5, and the probability of tails (`P(X=T)`) is also 0.5.
- **Discrete vs Continuous Distributions**:
  - **Discrete**: The random variable can take specific values (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses).
  - **Continuous**: The random variable can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).
- **Uniform Distribution**:
  - All outcomes in a range `[a, b]` are equally likely.
  - Example: Rolling a fair die has a uniform distribution over the numbers 1 to 6.

---

### **4. Gaussian (Normal) Distribution**
- **Definition**: A bell-shaped curve that describes many natural phenomena (e.g., heights, test scores).
- **Key Properties**:
  - Centered around the mean (`μ`).
  - Spread determined by the standard deviation (`σ`).
  - Probabilities:
    - 68.3% of data falls within 1 standard deviation (`μ ± σ`).
    - 95.4% falls within 2 standard deviations (`μ ± 2σ`).
    - 99.7% falls within 3 standard deviations (`μ ± 3σ`).
- **Formula**:
  ```math
  f(x) = (1 / √(2πσ²)) * e^(-(x - μ)² / (2σ²))
  ```
  - This gives the probability density at a specific value `x`.

---

### **5. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**
- **Definition**: The CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specific value.
  - Example: For a Gaussian distribution, the CDF at `x` tells us the probability of observing a value less than `x`.
- **Relation to Probability Density Function (PDF)**:
  - The PDF describes the likelihood of specific values.
  - The CDF is the integral (sum) of the PDF up to a specific value.

---

### **6. Bernoulli Trials**
- **Definition**: A random process with exactly two outcomes (e.g., success/failure, head/tail).
- **Examples**:
  - Tossing a coin (success = heads, failure = tails).
  - Drawing an Ace of Spades from a deck (success = Ace of Spades, failure = any other card).
- **Probability**:
  - Success probability = `p`.
  - Failure probability = `q = 1 - p`.

---

### **7. Binomial Distribution**
- **Definition**: Describes the number of successes in `n` independent Bernoulli trials.
  - Example: Tossing a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads.
- **Formula**:
  ```math
  P(k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
  ```
  - `n choose k` = Number of ways to choose `k` successes from `n` trials.
  - `p^k` = Probability of `k` successes.
  - `(1-p)^(n-k)` = Probability of `n-k` failures.
- **R Example**:
  ```r
  k <- 0:15  # Possible number of successes
  plot(k, choose(15, k) * 0.2^k * 0.8^(15-k), type='h', lwd=3, ylab='Probability')
  ```

### **8. Sampling in R**
- **Purpose**: Simulate random data from a specific distribution.
- **Functions**:
  - `rnorm(n, mean, sd)`: Generate `n` random values from a normal distribution.
  - `runif(n, min, max)`: Generate `n` random values from a uniform distribution.
  - `rbinom(n, size, prob)`: Generate `n` random values from a binomial distribution.
- **Example**:
  ```r
  set.seed(1)  # Ensures reproducibility
  y <- rnorm(20, mean=120, sd=15)  # 20 random values, mean=120, sd=15
  hist(y, breaks=10)  # Plot histogram of the sample
  ```

---

### **9. Empirical vs Theoretical Distributions**
- **Empirical Distribution**:
  - Based on observed data (e.g., a histogram of sampled values).
  - Example: Sampling 100 values from a Gaussian distribution and plotting a histogram.
- **Theoretical Distribution**:
  - The ideal distribution (e.g., Gaussian) from which the data is sampled.
  - Example: The bell curve of a normal distribution.

---

### **10. Randomness in Sampling**
- **Small Samples**:
  - May not perfectly reflect the underlying distribution due to sampling fluctuations.
  - Example: Sampling 20 values from a Gaussian distribution may give a mean far from the true mean.
- **Larger Samples**:
  - Reduce fluctuations and better approximate the theoretical distribution.
- **Reproducibility**:
  - Use `set.seed()` to ensure the same random numbers are generated every time.
  - Example:
    ```r
    set.seed(42)
    rnorm(5)  # Always generates the same 5 random numbers
    ```

---

### **11. Combinatorics**
- **Definition**: The study of counting combinations and permutations.
- **Key Formula**:
  - Number of ways to choose `k` objects from `n`:
    ```math
    n choose k = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)
    ```
- **R Function**:
  - `choose(n, k)`: Computes the number of combinations.
  - Example:
    ```r
    choose(81, 20)  # Number of ways to choose 20 objects from 81
    ```

### **1. Non-Parametric Hypothesis Testing: Mann-Whitney U Test**
- **When to Use**:
  - The Mann-Whitney U Test (also known as the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) is used when the data is **not normally distributed**.
  - It is a **non-parametric test**, meaning it does not assume any specific distribution for the data.
  - It is used to compare two independent groups to determine if their distributions differ significantly.

#### **Definition**:
- The Mann-Whitney U Test calculates two statistics, `U1` and `U2`, based on the ranks of the data:
  ```math
  U1 = n1 * n2 + (n1 * (n1 + 1)) / 2 - R1
  U2 = n1 * n2 + (n2 * (n2 + 1)) / 2 - R2
  ```
  - `n1` and `n2` are the sample sizes of the two groups.
  - `R1` and `R2` are the sums of the ranks for the two groups.

#### **Assumptions**:
1. The two groups being compared are **independent**.
2. The data is **continuous**.
3. Both samples are **randomly selected**.

### **2. Performing the Mann-Whitney U Test in R**
- **Function**: `wilcox.test()`
- **Example**:
  ```r
  wilcox.test(blood_storage$Median.RBC.Age, blood_storage$PreopPSA, 
              conf.int = TRUE, paired = FALSE)
  ```
  - `blood_storage$Median.RBC.Age`: Data for the first group.
  - `blood_storage$PreopPSA`: Data for the second group.
  - `conf.int = TRUE`: Requests a confidence interval for the difference in location.
  - `paired = FALSE`: Indicates that the samples are independent.

#### **Output**:
- Example output:
  ```
  Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

  data:  blood_storage$Median.RBC.Age and blood_storage$PreopPSA
  W = 88005, p-value < 2.2e-16
  alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
  95 percent confidence interval:
   7.199952 9.200053
  sample estimates:
  difference in location 
                8.300047
  ```
  - **W**: The test statistic.
  - **p-value**: Indicates the probability of observing the data under the null hypothesis (no difference between groups).
  - **Confidence Interval**: The range of values for the difference in location between the two groups.
  - **Difference in Location**: The estimated difference between the medians of the two groups.

#### **Interpretation**:
- A **small p-value** (e.g., `< 0.05`) suggests that the two groups are significantly different.
- The **confidence interval** provides a range for the difference in medians. If it does not include 0, the difference is significant.

### **3. Example Explanation**
- **Scenario**:
  - You want to determine if there is a significant difference between `Median.RBC.Age` and `PreopPSA` in the `blood_storage` dataset.
- **Code**:
  ```r
  wilcox.test(blood_storage$Median.RBC.Age, blood_storage$PreopPSA, 
              conf.int = TRUE, paired = FALSE)
  ```
- **Output**:
  - The p-value is `< 2.2e-16`, which is extremely small, indicating a significant difference between the two groups.
  - The confidence interval `[7.199952, 9.200053]` does not include 0, further confirming the significant difference.
  - The estimated difference in location (median) is `8.300047`.

### **4. Key Takeaways**
1. **Mann-Whitney U Test**:
   - A non-parametric alternative to the t-test.
   - Used when data is not normally distributed.
   - Compares the medians of two independent groups.
2. **R Implementation**:
   - Use the `wilcox.test()` function.
   - Interpret the p-value, confidence interval, and difference in location.
3. **Practical Application**:
   - Useful in biomedical statistics when data violates normality assumptions.
   - Provides robust results without requiring transformations of the data.

## **1. Overview of Confidence Intervals**
- **What is a Confidence Interval (CI)?**
  - A confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (e.g., the mean) with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).
  - Example: If we calculate a 95% CI for a sample mean, we are saying that if we repeated the sampling process many times, 95% of the intervals would contain the true mean.

- **Why Use Confidence Intervals?**
  - They provide more information than a simple hypothesis test (which gives a binary "reject" or "fail to reject" decision).
  - CIs give a range of plausible values for the population parameter, helping us understand the uncertainty in our estimates.

## **2. Confidence Intervals with Known Variance**
### **Key Equations**
1. **Distribution of the Sample Mean**:
   𝑓(𝑥¯)∝𝑒𝑥𝑝(−(𝑥¯−𝜇)²/2(𝜎/𝑛√)²)
   - 𝑥¯: Sample mean.
   - 𝜇: True population mean.
   - 𝜎/𝑛√: Standard error of the mean (SEM), which measures how much the sample mean varies from sample to sample.

2. **Z-Score**:
   𝑍=𝑥¯−𝜇/𝜎/𝑛√
   - The Z-score standardizes the sample mean by expressing it in terms of standard deviations from the population mean.

3. **Standard Normal Distribution**:
   𝑓(𝑍)=1/√2𝜋 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑍²/2)
   - This is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).

4. **Confidence Interval Formula**:
   𝑥¯−𝑧₀𝜎/𝑛√<𝜇<𝑥¯+𝑧₀𝜎/𝑛√
   - 𝑧₀: Critical value from the standard normal distribution for the desired confidence level (e.g., 𝑧₀=1.96 for 95% confidence).

### **Explanation**
- When the population variance (𝜎²) is known, the sample mean follows a normal distribution.
- The Z-score helps us determine how far the sample mean is from the population mean in terms of standard deviations.
- For a 95% confidence interval, we use 𝑧₀=1.96, which corresponds to the middle 95% of the standard normal distribution.

## **3. Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing**
### **Key Concepts**
- **Relationship Between CIs and Hypothesis Testing**:
  - If the confidence interval does not include the null hypothesis value (e.g., 𝜇=0), we reject the null hypothesis.
  - If the confidence interval includes the null hypothesis value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

- **Significance Level (𝛼)**:
  - The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error).
  - For a 95% confidence interval, 𝛼=0.05.

### **Key Equations**
1. **Probability of Z-Score**:
   𝑃(−𝑧₀<𝑍<𝑧₀)+𝑃(|𝑍|>𝑧₀)=1
   - This equation shows that the total probability under the standard normal curve is 1.

2. **Confidence Interval and Hypothesis Testing**:
   - If the sample mean satisfies:
     𝑥¯>𝑧₀𝜎/𝑛√
     - The result is significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.

### **Explanation**
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are closely related. Both use the same underlying statistical principles but present the results differently:
  - Hypothesis testing gives a binary decision (reject or fail to reject).
  - Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter.

## **4. Confidence Intervals with Unknown Variance**
### **Key Concepts**
- In most real-world scenarios, the population variance (𝜎²) is unknown. Instead, we estimate it using the sample standard deviation (𝑠).
- Substituting 𝑠 for 𝜎 introduces additional uncertainty, so we use the **t-distribution** instead of the normal distribution.

### **Key Equations**
1. **T-Statistic**:
   𝑇=𝑥¯−𝜇/𝑠/𝑛√
   - Similar to the Z-score but accounts for the variability in 𝑠.

2. **Confidence Interval with T-Distribution**:
   𝑥¯−𝑡₀𝑠/𝑛√<𝜇<𝑥¯+𝑡₀𝑠/𝑛√
   - 𝑡₀: Critical value from the t-distribution for 𝑛−1 degrees of freedom.

### **Explanation**
- The t-distribution is used when the sample size is small or the population variance is unknown.
- The t-distribution is wider than the normal distribution, reflecting the additional uncertainty from estimating 𝜎 with 𝑠.

## **5. Chi-Square and T-Distributions**
### **Key Concepts**
- The t-distribution arises from the ratio of a normal variable to a chi-square variable.
- The chi-square distribution is used to describe the variability of the sample variance.

### **Key Equations**
1. **Chi-Square Distribution**:
   𝑌=𝑋₁²+𝑋₂²+...+𝑋ₙ²
   - The sum of squares of independent normal variables follows a chi-square distribution.

2. **T-Distribution**:
   𝑇=𝑥¯−𝜇/𝑠/𝑛√
   - The t-distribution describes the probability density of the t-statistic.

### **Explanation**
- The t-distribution is used for small sample sizes or when the population variance is unknown.
- As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.

## **6. Example in R**
### **Code Walkthrough**
1. **Generate a Random Sample**:
   ```R
   x <- rnorm(5)  # Generate a random sample of size 5
   ```

2. **Fit a Linear Model**:
   ```R
   confint(lm(x ~ 1))  # Compute confidence interval for the mean
   ```
   - The intercept of the linear model represents the sample mean.

3. **Manually Compute the Confidence Interval**:
   - Calculate the sample mean (𝑥¯) and standard deviation (𝑠).
   - Find the critical value (𝑡₀) for the t-distribution with 𝑛−1 degrees of freedom.
   - Use the formula:
     𝑥¯−𝑡₀𝑠/𝑛√<𝜇<𝑥¯+𝑡₀𝑠/𝑛√

## **7. Key Takeaways**
- Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter.
- Use the normal distribution when the population variance is known and the t-distribution when it is unknown.
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are closely related and often convey the same information.

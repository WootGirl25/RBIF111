Initial prompt:
I am struggling to understand these notes for my class biomedical statistics with R.
Can you please break down each section, describe what is happening in each statistical formula (keep the equasion number so I can reference it), and keep each formula in its symbolic notation. Then please summarize each section as you go, and provide an explanation in plain easy to understand english.

Correct symbols:
see the symbols in the formula here is <>, 
but I want it to remain as <>
Is there a way to change all these in the response you provided?

Check for errors in notes:
last question - do these notes look correct to you? sometimes there can be mistakes in the originals.

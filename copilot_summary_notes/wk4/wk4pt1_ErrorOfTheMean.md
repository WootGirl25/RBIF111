Yes, I can adjust the response to keep the formulas in the exact format you provided (e.g., `Var(X)=E[(x−μ)2]=∫(x−μ)2f(x)dx`). Let me revise the explanation accordingly.

### Breakdown of the Notes (Revised)

#### **1. Overview**
This section introduces the topic: understanding the error involved in estimating the true mean of a population using the sample mean. The notes outline three steps:
1. Review the variance and its properties.
2. Characterize the spread (error) of the sample mean as a random variable.
3. Perform a numerical simulation to observe the derived formula in action.

**Summary**: The goal is to understand how accurately the sample mean estimates the true mean and how this error behaves mathematically and practically.

---

#### **2. Properties of Variance**

##### **Definition of Variance**
The variance of a random variable \( X \) is defined as:

**(1)**  
\[
Var(X)=E[(x−μ)2]=∫(x−μ)2f(x)dx
\]

- \( E[] \): Expected value (average over all possible outcomes).
- \( μ \): Population mean, defined as:

**(2)**  
\[
μ=E[x]=∫xf(x)dx
\]

**Explanation**: Variance measures how far the values of \( X \) deviate from the mean \( μ \). It is the average of the squared differences between \( X \) and \( μ \).

##### **Standard Deviation**
The standard deviation \( σ_X \) is the square root of the variance:

\[
σ_X=√Var(X)
\]

**Key Point**: Variance and standard deviation describe the spread of a random variable. These are fixed values for a given distribution.

##### **Sample vs. Population**
- Population mean (\( μ \)) and variance (\( Var(X) \)) are fixed values based on the true distribution \( f(x) \).
- Sample mean and sample variance are random variables because they depend on the specific sample drawn.

**Summary**: Variance quantifies the spread of a random variable, while standard deviation is its square root. Population parameters are fixed, but sample statistics vary depending on the sample.

---

##### **Rewriting Variance**
Using the properties of expected values, variance can be rewritten as:

**(3)**  
\[
Var(X)=E[(x−μ)2]=E[x2−2μx+μ2]=E[x2]−2μE[x]+μ2=E[x2]−μ2
\]

This is derived by expanding \( (x−μ)^2 \) and using the linearity of expectation.

##### **Expected Value of a Constant**
For a constant \( a \):

**(4)**  
\[
E[ax]=∫axf(x)dx=a∫xf(x)dx=aE[x]
\]

**(5)**  
\[
E[a]=∫af(x)dx=a∫f(x)dx=a
\]

**Summary**: Variance can be simplified using properties of expected values. Constants behave predictably under expectation.

---

##### **Variance of a Scaled Variable**
If \( X \) is scaled by a constant \( a \), the variance changes as:

**(6)**  
\[
Var(aX)=a^2*Var(X)
\]

**Explanation**: Scaling a variable by \( a \) scales its variance by \( a^2 \).

##### **Variance of a Sum**
For two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \):

**(7)**  
\[
Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)+2Cov(X,Y)
\]

Where covariance is:

**(8)**  
\[
Cov(X,Y)=E[(x−μx)(y−μy)]
\]

If \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent, \( Cov(X,Y)=0 \), so:

**(9)**  
\[
Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)
\]

This generalizes to \( n \) independent variables:

**(10)**  
\[
Var(X1+...+Xn)=Var(X1)+...+Var(Xn)
\]

**Summary**: Variance scales with constants and sums. For independent variables, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances.

---

#### **3. Standard Error of the Sample Mean**

##### **Sample Mean**
The sample mean for a sample \( x1,...,xn \) is:

**(11)**  
\[
x¯=1n∑i=1nxi
\]

This is an estimator for the population mean \( μ \). As \( n→∞ \), \( x¯→μ \) (law of large numbers).

##### **Variance of the Sample Mean**
The sample mean \( x¯ \) is a random variable. Its variance is:

**(12)**  
\[
x¯=(X1+X2+...+Xn)/n
\]

Using properties of variance:

**(13)**  
\[
Var(x¯)=Var(X1/n+X2/n+...+Xn/n)=1n2(Var(X1)+...+Var(Xn))
\]

Since the random variables \( Xi \) are identically distributed:

**(14)**  
\[
Var(x¯)=Var(X)/n
\]

Taking the square root gives the standard deviation of the sample mean (standard error):

**(15)**  
\[
σx¯=σX/√n
\]

**Explanation**: The standard error decreases as the sample size \( n \) increases. Larger samples provide more accurate estimates of the population mean.

##### **Practical Implications**
- To achieve a 10-fold improvement in accuracy, the sample size must increase 100-fold.
- The standard error is inversely proportional to \( √n \).

**Summary**: The standard error quantifies the typical error in estimating the population mean using the sample mean. It decreases with larger sample sizes.

---

#### **4. Numerical Simulation**

The simulation demonstrates the theoretical results using R. Key steps:
1. Define sample sizes (\( n \)).
2. For each \( n \), draw 1000 samples from a normal distribution.
3. Compute the sample means and their standard deviation (SEM).
4. Compare the simulated SEM to the theoretical prediction \( 1/√n \).

**Key Code Snippets**:
```r
smpl.sizes <- c(1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128) # sample sizes
r.mu <- numeric()
r.sem <- numeric()
n.sim <- 1000
for (i.smpl in smpl.sizes) {
  r.mat <- matrix(rnorm(i.smpl * n.sim), nrow = n.sim, ncol = i.smpl)
  mu.tmp <- apply(r.mat, 1, mean)
  r.mu <- c(r.mu, mean(mu.tmp))
  r.sem <- c(r.sem, sd(mu.tmp))
}
```

The plot compares the simulated SEM to the theoretical curve \( 1/√n \), showing perfect agreement.

**Summary**: The simulation confirms that the standard error decreases with increasing sample size, as predicted by the formula.

---

### Final Summary
- **Variance** measures the spread of a random variable, while standard deviation is its square root.
- **Sample statistics** (e.g., sample mean) are random variables with their own distributions.
- The **standard error** quantifies the error in estimating the population mean using the sample mean and decreases with larger sample sizes.
- The **numerical simulation** validates the theoretical relationship between sample size and standard error.

Certainly! I'll break the document into detailed sections and explain each part thoroughly. I'll focus on the key equations, their meaning, and how they relate to the broader concepts of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

## **1. Overview of Confidence Intervals**
- **What is a Confidence Interval (CI)?**
  - A confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (e.g., the mean) with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).
  - Example: If we calculate a 95% CI for a sample mean, we are saying that if we repeated the sampling process many times, 95% of the intervals would contain the true mean.

- **Why Use Confidence Intervals?**
  - They provide more information than a simple hypothesis test (which gives a binary "reject" or "fail to reject" decision).
  - CIs give a range of plausible values for the population parameter, helping us understand the uncertainty in our estimates.

## **2. Confidence Intervals with Known Variance**
### **Key Equations**
1. **Distribution of the Sample Mean**:
   \[
   f(\bar{x}) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{(\bar{x} - \mu)^2}{2(\sigma / \sqrt{n})^2}\right)
   \]
   - \( \bar{x} \): Sample mean.
   - \( \mu \): True population mean.
   - \( \sigma / \sqrt{n} \): Standard error of the mean (SEM), which measures how much the sample mean varies from sample to sample.

2. **Z-Score**:
   \[
   Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
   \]
   - The Z-score standardizes the sample mean by expressing it in terms of standard deviations from the population mean.

3. **Standard Normal Distribution**:
   \[
   f(Z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{Z^2}{2}\right)
   \]
   - This is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).

4. **Confidence Interval Formula**:
   \[
   \bar{x} - z_0 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \bar{x} + z_0 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
   \]
   - \( z_0 \): Critical value from the standard normal distribution for the desired confidence level (e.g., \( z_0 = 1.96 \) for 95% confidence).

### **Explanation**
- When the population variance (\( \sigma^2 \)) is known, the sample mean follows a normal distribution.
- The Z-score helps us determine how far the sample mean is from the population mean in terms of standard deviations.
- For a 95% confidence interval, we use \( z_0 = 1.96 \), which corresponds to the middle 95% of the standard normal distribution.

## **3. Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing**
### **Key Concepts**
- **Relationship Between CIs and Hypothesis Testing**:
  - If the confidence interval does not include the null hypothesis value (e.g., \( \mu = 0 \)), we reject the null hypothesis.
  - If the confidence interval includes the null hypothesis value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

- **Significance Level (\( \alpha \))**:
  - The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error).
  - For a 95% confidence interval, \( \alpha = 0.05 \).

### **Key Equations**
1. **Probability of Z-Score**:
   \[
   P(-z_0 < Z < z_0) + P(|Z| > z_0) = 1
   \]
   - This equation shows that the total probability under the standard normal curve is 1.

2. **Confidence Interval and Hypothesis Testing**:
   - If the sample mean satisfies:
     \[
     \bar{x} > z_0 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
     \]
     - The result is significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected.

### **Explanation**
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are closely related. Both use the same underlying statistical principles but present the results differently:
  - Hypothesis testing gives a binary decision (reject or fail to reject).
  - Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter.

## **4. Confidence Intervals with Unknown Variance**
### **Key Concepts**
- In most real-world scenarios, the population variance (\( \sigma^2 \)) is unknown. Instead, we estimate it using the sample standard deviation (\( s \)).
- Substituting \( s \) for \( \sigma \) introduces additional uncertainty, so we use the **t-distribution** instead of the normal distribution.

### **Key Equations**
1. **T-Statistic**:
   \[
   T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
   \]
   - Similar to the Z-score but accounts for the variability in \( s \).

2. **Confidence Interval with T-Distribution**:
   \[
   \bar{x} - t_0 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \bar{x} + t_0 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
   \]
   - \( t_0 \): Critical value from the t-distribution for \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom.

### **Explanation**
- The t-distribution is used when the sample size is small or the population variance is unknown.
- The t-distribution is wider than the normal distribution, reflecting the additional uncertainty from estimating \( \sigma \) with \( s \).

## **5. Chi-Square and T-Distributions**
### **Key Concepts**
- The t-distribution arises from the ratio of a normal variable to a chi-square variable.
- The chi-square distribution is used to describe the variability of the sample variance.

### **Key Equations**
1. **Chi-Square Distribution**:
   \[
   Y = X_1^2 + X_2^2 + \dots + X_n^2
   \]
   - The sum of squares of independent normal variables follows a chi-square distribution.

2. **T-Distribution**:
   \[
   T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
   \]
   - The t-distribution describes the probability density of the t-statistic.

### **Explanation**
- The t-distribution is used for small sample sizes or when the population variance is unknown.
- As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.

## **6. Example in R**
### **Code Walkthrough**
1. **Generate a Random Sample**:
   ```R
   x <- rnorm(5)  # Generate a random sample of size 5
   ```

2. **Fit a Linear Model**:
   ```R
   confint(lm(x ~ 1))  # Compute confidence interval for the mean
   ```
   - The intercept of the linear model represents the sample mean.

3. **Manually Compute the Confidence Interval**:
   - Calculate the sample mean (\( \bar{x} \)) and standard deviation (\( s \)).
   - Find the critical value (\( t_0 \)) for the t-distribution with \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom.
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     \bar{x} - t_0 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \bar{x} + t_0 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
     \]

## **7. Key Takeaways**
- Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter.
- Use the normal distribution when the population variance is known and the t-distribution when it is unknown.
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are closely related and often convey the same information.
